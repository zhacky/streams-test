## About The Project

---
This project is for Java developers to practice their Stream API coding skill.

### Getting Started

---
The `UsingStreams.java` class contains several empty methods that you need
to populate with your implementations.

Run The `UsingStreamsTest` to check the failing tests and make them
pass using your implementations.

You can also export the file into the exportToHTML folder for a 
printed version.
